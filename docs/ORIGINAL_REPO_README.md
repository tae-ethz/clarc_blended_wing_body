# BlendedNet: FiLM-Based Aerodynamic Field Prediction

This repository contains the codebase used in the ASME IDETC 2025 paper:

**"BlendedNet: A Blended Wing Body Aircraft Dataset and Surrogate Model for Aerodynamic Predictions"**\
*Presented at ASME IDETC/CIE 2025, Anaheim, CA*

The project introduces a public high-fidelity dataset for blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, as well as a two-stage surrogate model combining PointNet and FiLM-based neural networks to predict pointwise aerodynamic coefficients. 

The dataset is publicly available at: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VJT9EP

## 📊 Dataset Overview

BlendedNet is the first open dataset to provide high-resolution **pointwise aerodynamic surface coefficients** for BWB aircraft.

Each case contains:

- Geometric design parameters (9 shape parameters)
- Flight conditions (altitude, Mach, angle of attack, Reynolds length)
- CFD-derived outputs:
  - Cp (pressure coefficient)
  - Cf\_x, Cf\_z (skin friction in x/z)
  - Surface normals

Formats:

- `.csv` for metadata
- `.h5` for coordinates, normals, and coefficients
- `.vtk` for postprocessing and visualization

The dataset will be hosted on **Harvard Dataverse** (link pending).

## 🧠 Surrogate Model

### 1. **PointNet Regressor**

- Input: Sampled point cloud of the aircraft
- Output: 9 geometric shape parameters
- Permutation-invariant design

### 2. **FiLM Network**

- Input: 3D coordinates (+ normals), flight conditions, and shape parameters
- Output: Cp, Cf\_x, Cf\_z at each surface point
- Modulation via learned scale/shift (gamma, beta)
- Residual connections and sine activations
